Ski Station Management System 🏔️🎿

This project is part of my university coursework in the Spring Boot module, developed in collaboration with my professor and classmates. It is designed to manage a ski station, including pistes, skiers, instructors, courses, and subscriptions. The project is implemented using Spring Boot, JPA (Hibernate), and MySQL, following best practices in RESTful API development and software engineering principles.

📌 Features

✅ Skiers Management: Register and manage skiers with personal details.

✅ Pistes & Courses: Organize pistes based on difficulty levels and manage ski/snowboard courses.

✅ Instructors: Assign instructors to different courses.

✅ Subscriptions: Handle ski station subscriptions (Annual, Monthly, Semestrial).

✅ Spring Boot & JPA: Uses Spring Data JPA for database interactions.

✅ REST API: Exposes endpoints for CRUD operations.
